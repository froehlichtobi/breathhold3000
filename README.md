#### BreathHold3000 is a React.js based webapp with which you can train your breathhold time

### MAX HOLD TEST

The first function of my web app is the max. hold test, where you can test how long you can hold your breath and keep track of your highscore. The whole essence of this project is to improve the maximum breathhold time, in order to enjoy snorkeling for longer times, before needing to catch a breath on the surface. Mainly the users should use the breath training function, but from time to time it makes sense to come back to this max hold test, in order to see how much progress you are making.

### BREATH HOLD TRAINING

This function is the main reason I started this project. I watched YouTube videos about freediving and in one of those videos they showed this training technique, after that I started doing this training myself and shortly after I noticed how much easier it was to hold my breath. But one thing kept me from doing this regularly - it's really annyoing to keep track of the seconds with my iPhone timer app. That's the main reason I built this app, and it kept me really motivated, because I actually solve a "problem".

## story behind the project

My name is Tobias, I'm 22 years old and I'm from Austria. I started cs50 almost 2 years ago. Due to busy times in my current job it took my so long to finish it. But here I am :).
I came up with the idea for this project after traveling to the Philippines and snorkeling there. I got curious about freediving and stumbled upon a specific training technique to increase your breathhold time. I started doing this technique and found it very annoying to do so with the timer app on my iPhone. So I decided to build this app.

The app is built with React.js, I decided to use React because it's a very popular JavaScript library and I find it very appealing.
I didn't just want to create something that I can only run locally, so I looked for a free hosting provider and found Google Firebase.
For user authentication I use Firebase Authentication and for storing data I user Firestore Database.

This is actually my second project, I started this after I failed my first one, due to lack of code structuring and organization, I spent about 30 hours on my first project before cancelling it. But it taught me a lot. And so I was able to start this project with much more knowledge and I tried to keep the code as clean as possible.
I basically divided my codebase into 4 sections: authentication, components, database and logic. This helped me keep everything organized and to keep a better overview over all the code.
Obviously I am still pretty new to React and struggled a lot on certain topics. It took me a while to get the hang of parsing props down from the App.js to a child's child component :D

The code is probably not very good, and all the functions are not perfect, but still I'm pretty satisfied with the result.
I still want to continue working on this project and add a statistics page and a leaderboard in the future.

Before starting the project I did some React tutorials and tried to learn the basics, still it was very hard for me to actually start my own project without someone explaining me what to do exactly.
I used ChatGPT working on this project, but I worked TOGETHER with ChatGPT, and not just copy pasted code. I tried to use ChatGPT to explain concepts to me, which I could later apply on my own. Before using anything that ChatGPT gave me I tried very hard to understand the essence of it. But of course it's very useful to use an AI for example for using Firebase Authentication, because it can just give you the basic functions and how to implement them, without the need of reading through the whole documentation or watching YouTube tutorials.
It was a very good decision to host the app with Firebase, that kept me so motivated, because I was building something that could actually be used by people, no matter where they are from. In the building process I often sent the link to my app to some friends so that they could test it and give me some feedback on the design (most of them don't know how to code, but they could tell me what I could improve design-wise).

### Thank you for cs50!
